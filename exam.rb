#Â A planner reads a CSV, builds a collection of students and hours
# and is able to calculate the best starting times to maximize attendability
# 
# To achieve the first requirement, we measure the attendabilities for each
# combination of Monday and Wednesday hours, as the number of students that
# can attend at least one of the meetings.
#
# To achieve the second requirement, we do a similar measure for the scores
# being 0, 1, or 2 for each student meaning the number of meetings that will
# be able to attend for each given combination of Monday and Wednesday times.
#
# We then pick the highest attainability, and for those combinations meeting it,
# we choose the one with the best total score to maximize it
